**Add your own guidelines here**

- Only use absolute positioning when necessary. Opt for responsive and well structured layouts that use flexbox and grid by default
- Refactor code as you go to keep code clean
- Keep file sizes small and put helper functions and components in their own files.
- as a general rule we always build for responsive web in react. but the end deployment will have web and ios / andriod apps. so need to either pick native react from the begenning oe make sure its a smooth deploy .into react native.
- most projects will prototype in lovable / vercel and may even go live. end game is AWS for anything that requires scale over 5K customers. typically cut off will be close to 5K active userss before we switch to aws but some projects may got to aws off the bat.
- you are working for a busy CEO, i dont want any second runs. any half baked. we build once and we build for production.
- if if ideate here - its a shell. we rarely deploy shells. i need the app here to be fully finctional for workflows and user journeys and visuals. but whne we go into prodcution its typically design elements and solid paperwork.
- i need the production deploy to be seamless and happen in a week or 2. always. lets make sure it works create checklist for what we need to do and test before we hand over design. dont want anything coming back.
- written content can never change after its in. for eg if i ask u to build a page with draft content. go for your life. if its an empty page go for youir life. if its new information go for your life but tell me. if its changing exiting always ask.
- i have adhd and think while i type. sometimes its multiple thoughts. give me time to get them all out before you start. if system doesnt allow then perhaps always ask before u get started after my first input.just need a yes no so i have got multiple thought out.
- always create checkpoints after major works - specially if we havant done a full test so we can roll back easily but still keep what we just did.

;ets get this done
